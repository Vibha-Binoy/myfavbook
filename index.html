		<h2>Books</h2>
		<p>I love reading and have read many books of J.K Rowling, Rolh Dalh, Sudha Murthy, R.K Narayanan,etc. This is some information about my favourite book of all............</p>
		<h1>Harry Potter</h1>
		<p>Harry Potter is an awesoeme book to read. It increases your vocabulary and speech skills. I almost became a bookworm reading Harry Potter as it takes you to a totally different world of magic</p>
		<h2>What is Harry Potter about?</h2>
		<img src="https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTQ3OTg2NjQ0NDg0NDk4OTEx/hp_cropped_gettyimages-113941726.jpg" style="float:right;width:10%;height:15%;">
		<p>Harry Potter is the story of  a little 11 year old boy who was forced to live with his really mean uncle and aunt as his parents were killed by the darkest wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort.
		Harry was treated like he was just a bit of dirt by his uncle and aunt and in the book we see how this little normal boy grows up to be a person who saves the world just with a bit of "moral fibre" and most of all love!</p>
		<h2>Why Harry Potter is such a good novel</h2>
		<p>
			Many people wonder why J.K Rowling's Harry Potter novel series got so famous, there is only one simple reason- it's because of the way it's written. We literally fell like as if we are growing up with Harry when we read the series this is because JKR has written each and every felling of Harry<br>
			Also JKR's wizarding world which she created while writing is just unbelievalble it has all the things the normal world has and it also has magic!Her writing makes us want to be a part of her story<br>
			Most importantly reading HP adds a bit of Magic into us!
